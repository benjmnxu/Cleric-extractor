00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:40,520
John: Okay, let's revisit the topic of using websockets. I think it's crucial for real-time data, and we should implement it despite the effort.

2
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:49,190
Sara: John, I understand the benefits, but I still feel it's overkill at this stage. We should focus on getting the base features right first. Adding websockets now could delay our entire timeline.

3
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,040
Mike: I'm siding with Sara here. We're spreading ourselves too thin. Let's nail the basics before adding complexity.


1
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:30,520
John: Reflecting on the feedback, maybe we delay websockets but prepare our infrastructure to support it in the future. Does that sound like a compromise?

2
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:39,190
Sara: That's a more reasonable approach. I can agree to that as long as it doesn't deviate from our core development goals.

3
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,040
Mike: Okay, preparing for future integration without immediate implementation works for me.


1
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:40,520
John: Moving on, I think we should reconsider the color palette. The current selection doesn't align well with our brand identity.

2
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:49,190
Sara: John, we've already decided on the color palette last week. Constantly revisiting decisions will stall our progress.

3
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,040
Mike: I agree with Sara. We need to start locking in decisions, or we'll never move forward.


1
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:30,520
John: I hear you both, but what if we just tweak the shades slightly? I'm not suggesting a complete overhaul.

2
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:39,190
Sara: Minor tweaks could be acceptable, but let's limit it to that. We can't afford more significant changes at this point.

3
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,040
Mike: Fine, but this is the last change to the palette. We need to finalize it now.


1
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:40,520
John: Lastly, regarding the modular design, are we all on board with this moving forward? We need a solid decision here.

2
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:49,190
Sara: Honestly, John, I think we're trying to do too much with the modular approach. It's adding unnecessary complexity.

3
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,040
Mike: I'm with Sara. Let's simplify and make our product more straightforward. Modular design can wait.
'''What are our product decisions

The team has decided not to proceed with the modular design and instead will simplify the product to make it more straightforward.
The team will make minor tweaks to the shades of the product's palette.
This is the last change to the product's palette.
The team's approach will not deviate from their core development goals.
