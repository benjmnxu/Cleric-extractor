00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:34,320
John: Let's discuss the marketing strategy for the upcoming product launch. I think we should focus heavily on social media promotions to reach a broader audience.

2
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:42,190
Sara: Social media sounds fine, but I’m not convinced it should be our main channel. We might be missing out on our older demographic that way. Why not consider more traditional methods as well, like TV and print ads?

3
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,040
Mike: I have to side with Sara here. We should have a balanced approach. Also, I propose we cut down the budget for the launch event and redirect those funds into these advertisements.

4
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,050
Lily: Why cut the launch event budget? That’s our biggest opportunity to make a splash in the industry. Let’s keep the event and just increase the overall marketing budget.


1
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:40,520
John: Reflecting on our earlier discussion, maybe we can reduce the scale of the launch event rather than cutting the budget entirely. This way, we can still have an impact but save some funds for additional marketing channels.

2
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:49,190
Sara: A smaller event could work, but then we must absolutely nail our digital campaign to make up for the reduced physical presence.

3
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,040
Mike: Agreed. And let’s make sure we target our ads more precisely this time. We can’t afford broad, inefficient spending.

4
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,700
Lily: Targeting is key, I agree. But let’s not forget the content of these ads needs to be top-notch. We can’t just rely on targeting.


1
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:40,520
John: Moving forward, let’s discuss the possibility of a partnership for the product launch. Partnering with a well-known brand could give us the edge we need.

2
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:49,190
Sara: Partnerships are a double-edged sword. We need to ensure that our partner’s audience aligns with ours. Otherwise, it’s just wasted effort.

3
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,040
Mike: I'm wary of partnerships. It could complicate our messaging and dilute our brand. We should proceed with caution.

4
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,700
Lily: I think a strategic partnership would be beneficial if chosen wisely. It could amplify our reach and credibility.


1
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:40,520
John: Considering all your inputs, perhaps we should focus on finding a partner that complements our strengths rather than just any big name in the industry.

2
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:49,190
Sara: That’s a sensible approach. A partner that aligns with our technology and customer base would indeed add value.

3
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,040
Mike: As long as we maintain control over the campaign and messaging, I’m on board.

4
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,700
Lily: It's settled then. Let’s start identifying potential partners but keep our brand’s integrity and message as the priority.
