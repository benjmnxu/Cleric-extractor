John: I think we should definitely prioritize our launch event in New York. It’s a big market and could really push our project into the limelight.

2
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:49,190
Sara: New York, really? I was under the impression that we were leaning towards launching in San Francisco given the tech crowd and investor presence. We should reconsider this.

3
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,040
Mike: Both of you have points, but what about the costs associated with each location? We need to budget carefully, and New York is notoriously expensive.

4
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:58,120
Linda: Not to mention, the logistical nightmare New York could pose. I suggest we look into Chicago as well; it’s a good middle ground, cost-effective and logistically feasible.


1
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:20,520
John: Reflecting on our last discussion, I still think New York is viable if we secure the right sponsors. We shouldn’t dismiss it solely based on cost.

2
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:29,190
Sara: Sponsors or not, our main focus should be accessibility for our guests and potential partners. I still advocate for San Francisco or even Seattle.

3
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,040
Mike: I think we're overlooking potential in other cities with rich tech communities. What about Austin or Denver?

4
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:38,120
Linda: Let’s compile a cost-benefit analysis for each city. I think it’s the only way we’ll reach a consensus without going in circles about preferences.


1
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:50,520
John: Let’s shift gears and talk about the project timeline. I propose we lengthen phase one by two weeks to ensure all features are polished.

2
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:59,190
Sara: Extending phase one might delay our testing phase. We can’t afford to compromise on testing; it’s crucial for the project’s success.

3
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,040
Mike: I disagree with both. We should shorten phase one to accelerate our go-to-market. We can adjust as we progress.

4
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:08,120
Linda: Rushing can lead to mistakes. I support John’s idea of extending phase one, but only if we reassess our resources to maintain the testing phase duration.


1
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:20,520
John: Coming back to the location issue, I’ve contacted potential sponsors in New York, and there’s significant interest. This could offset some of the higher costs.

2
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:29,190
Sara: That’s promising, John. However, we need to consider the recent travel restrictions. It might affect attendees' ability to join in New York.

3
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,040
Mike: True, and we haven't even touched upon virtual engagement options yet. We should factor this into our decision.

4
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:38,120
Linda: I think it's wise to prepare for both in-person and virtual formats, regardless of the city we choose. Let’s not put all our eggs in one basket.
