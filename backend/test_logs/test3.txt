John: Back to our modular design conversation, I think it's essential. It adds complexity, sure, but the adaptability is worth the effort.

2
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,230
Sara: I completely disagree, John. The added complexity could delay our deployment significantly. We should opt for a more straightforward design to expedite market entry.

3
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:55,610
Mike: Both of you have points, but let's think about maintenance. A simpler design is easier to maintain and less prone to bugs. We should minimize features to essentials.


1
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:18,520
John: Speaking of features, I strongly propose we include an advanced analytics module. It’s vital for our clients to understand user behavior.

2
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:29,190
Sara: Honestly, John, that's overkill. Our project scope is already stretched. Let's focus on core functionalities and maybe consider analytics in phase two.

3
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:40,040
Mike: I’m siding with Sara here. Plus, adding analytics now would mean another round of testing and adjustments, pushing our deadlines even further.


1
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:30,520
John: Let's revisit the theme discussion. I propose we offer both dark and light themes from the start. It's a basic feature that many apps offer and it could set us apart.

2
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:39,190
Sara: Adding both themes doubles the design work. Our design team is already swamped. We need to prioritize tasks that add the most user value.

3
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:50,040
Mike: Agree with Sara. Let’s launch with one theme and gather user feedback. We can always introduce another theme based on demand. Let's not complicate the initial launch.


1
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:30,520
John: Considering the feedback, let’s focus on the desktop version but ensure the design is adaptable for mobile. We shouldn’t alienate mobile users.

2
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:49,190
Sara: It's a compromise, but it makes sense. We'll need to ensure the desktop design doesn’t compromise mobile usability.

3
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:58,040
Mike: That's adding back complexity, folks. We decided on desktop-first for a reason. Let’s not shift gears now. We can think about mobile adaptation later.
