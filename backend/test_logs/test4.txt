00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:40,520
John: I think we should definitely push for our event to be outdoors. It's more open, and we can accommodate more people that way.

2
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:49,190
Sara: I disagree, John. An outdoor event is too risky considering the unpredictable weather. We should book an indoor venue to avoid any disruptions.

3
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,040
Mike: Both of you have points, but what about considering a venue with both indoor and outdoor spaces? That way, we're covered regardless of the weather.

4
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:58,120
Lucy: I’m not sure about that. Managing two spaces might stretch our resources too thin. We need to focus on one area to ensure quality.


1
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:20,500
John: Reflecting more on it, maybe we should just go with an indoor venue but ensure there's ample outdoor-themed decor to give it an open feel.

2
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:30,720
Sara: That sounds like a compromise, but shifting to an outdoor-themed decor might increase our budget. We need to keep costs in mind.

3
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:40,940
Mike: I think we are straying from the main objective. We should focus on the content and activities of the event rather than the venue specifics.

4
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:50,160
Lucy: Agreed with Mike. Let’s finalize the speakers and activities first. We’re getting too caught up with the venue details.


1
00:02:52,210 --> 00:03:10,330
John: Back to the activities, I propose more interactive sessions. People should be engaged actively.

2
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:20,550
Sara: Interactive sessions are good, but we need to ensure there are also panels. We can't just have one type of activity; variety is key.

3
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:30,770
Mike: I’m concerned we’re overloading the schedule. People need downtime. Not everyone wants to go from one session to another.

4
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:40,990
Lucy: That’s a valid point. Let’s balance high-energy activities with some quieter, reflective sessions.


1
00:03:43,010 --> 00:04:00,130
John: Okay, but let’s make sure the reflective sessions aren’t just filler. They need to be as well-thought-out as the other activities.

2
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:10,350
Sara: Definitely, we can integrate some workshops with industry leaders for those sessions. It adds value and isn't just downtime.

3
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:20,570
Mike: Workshops are a great idea, but let’s not overcommit on big names that might not draw the attention we expect.

4
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:30,790
Lucy: Then perhaps we should consider emerging talents in the industry for workshops. They bring fresh perspectives and it's more cost-effective.
